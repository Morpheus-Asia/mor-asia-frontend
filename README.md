# Morpheus Asia Frontend

## Frontend Setup (mor-asia-frontend)

### 1. Repository Setup

1. Clone the `mor-asia-frontend` repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morpheus-Asia/mor-asia-frontend.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory using `cd`
```bash
cd mor-asia-frontend
```
4. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

1. Navigate to `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
2. Add the following variables:

```env
# STRAPI API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:1337

# Analytics
# This can be empty as it's not needed in development environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=

# Frontend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the frontend development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
Ensure both backend (`localhost:1337`) and frontend (`localhost:3000`) are running

**Note:** We are currently implementing backend mocking so that minor style changes don’t require the hassle of setting up the backend each time.

### 🎉 Your development environment is now up and running!

Proceed to read on to understand the project structure and how everything fits together.

## Folder Structure Introduction

This is a **Next.js 15** project built with [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [**Chakra UI**](https://chakra-ui.com/) for Morpheus Asia, with internationalization (i18n) support and a component-based architecture.

```bash
src
├── @types  # Shared types
├── app # NextJS App router folder (routes, API endpoints, layouts)
├── components # Reusable UI Pieces
├── containers # Larger sections made from multiple components
├── i18n # Translation 
├── Image # Static images
├── Renderer # Engine for rendering page data coming from Strapi dynamically
├── utils # Helper functions
└── middleware.ts
```

## node_modules/
Auto-generated by npm/Yarn. Contains all dependencies.  
You never edit this. Just reinstall with `npm install` if it’s broken.

## public/
Static assets served as-is (e.g. favicon, static images, robots.txt).  
Use when: You want a file to be publicly accessible without going through imports.  
Example: `/logo.png` → `https://site.com/logo.png`.

## src/ — Main Source Code
This is where all actual code lives.

### app/ (Next.js App Router)
All page routes live here. Uses folder-based routing.  
Use when: You want to create a new page, API endpoint, or layout.  
- Structure:  
  - `[locale]/` → Pages grouped by language (English, Chinese)  
  - `blog/`, `metrics/` → Specific sections/pages  
  - `api/` → Backend routes (e.g., pulling data from Strapi, metrics APIs)  
  - `layout.tsx` → App-wide wrappers (Chakra UI provider, etc.)  
  - `globals.css` → Global styles  

### components/ (Reusable UI Pieces)
- Small, reusable building blocks (buttons, navbars, charts, etc.)  
- Use when: You need a shared visual element anywhere in the app  
- Example:  
  - `ui/` → Core primitives (drawer, tooltip, menu)  
  - `Charts/` → All ApexCharts visualizations  
  - `Navbar/`, `Footer/`, `LanguageSwitcher/` → Site-wide components  

### containers/ (Page-Level Components)
- Larger “sections” made from multiple components  
- Use when: You’re building a full section of a page or a specialized layout  
- Example:  
  - `Hero/` → Landing page hero section  
  - `About/`, `JoinUs/`, `Metrics/` → Full structured sections  
  - `CapitalContributionMetrics/` → Specialized finance data display  

### @types/
- Custom TypeScript type definitions  
- Use when: You need to define interfaces for data models, props, or API responses  

### i18n/
- Internationalization setup & translation files  
- Use when: Adding new languages or editing text in different locales  
- Example: `en.json`, `cn.json`  

### Image/
- Static images used in the site  
- Use when: You need to store/import an image for usage in components  

### Renderer/
- Takes content from Strapi and maps it to React components dynamically  
- Use when: You want a new Strapi section type to appear in the frontend without rewriting page code  

### utils/
- Helper functions and reusable logic  
- Use when: You need a generic function (e.g., format numbers, fetch from Strapi) that multiple parts of the app can call  

### middleware.ts
- Runs before requests hit the page or API  
- Use when: You need locale detection, bot blocking, redirects, or custom request handling  ## Communication Tools
